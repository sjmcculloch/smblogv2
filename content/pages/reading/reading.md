Besieged in the Life Tree that is their fortress city, the Hylar struggle to survive. Magic and madness threaten from all sides as Theiwar, Daergar and Klar press the onslaught with bloodthirsty frenzy.

### Draconian Measures

The regiment of draconian engineers featured in "The Doom Brigade" seek a safe haven for their precious cargo of young draconians. All they have to do is stay alive. Surely that shouldn't be too hard. But Commander Kang puzzles over a sinister mystery. Why are some of his men vanishing? Kang will have to use draconian measures to defeat his foes and save his race. They'd better be enough -- the fate of his entire race hangs in the balance.

### The Second Generation

Years have passed since the end of the War of the Lance. Peace on Krynn comes at a price. The forces of darkness are ever vigilant, searching for ways to erode the balance of power and take control. When subtle changes begin to permeate the fragile peace, new lives are drawn into the web of fate woven around all the races. The time has come to pass the sword -- or the staff -- to the children of the Lance.
They are the Second Generation.

### The Doom Brigade

The fearless draconians of the War of the Lance have retired from the field of battle to a pleasant valley in the Kharolis Mountains. Well, it would be pleasant, if it weren't for some dwarves, whose irritating feuding prevents the draconians from realizing their greatest hope -- the ability to continue their doomed race. When the dwarves discover a map leading to a fortune buried in the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin, the draconians are swept up in a feverish race for treasure. Little do both sides realize that they are part of the strange and terrible destiny descending upon Krynn during the Summer of Flame.

### The Gates of Thorbardin

Legends tell that beneath the mountain fortress of Skullcap lie the remains of the dark wizard Fistandantilus and the path to the gates of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Buried somewhere along that perilous path is the magical helm of Grallen, son of King Duncan, tragic hero of the Dwarfgate War. Finding Grallen’s helm, it is prophesied, will herald the return of a united Thorbardin—but it will also open the gates of the realm to fresh horror and chaos.
